<h1>A Test Car Game for me</h1>
<p>
  I am making this game for learning purpose, will be trying to implement a simple car game with basic features turning, moving forward and reverse. A brief list of objectives is written below.
  <ol>
    <li>Go forward</li>
    <li>Make a left turn</li>
    <li>Make a right turn</li>
    <li>Go backwards (reverse)</li>
  </ol>
  Upon completion of the above will see make the game more intense.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  As above is completed let's change the game to bucket collector, that will collect fruits in a basket. Guess car game would require certain graphics so keeping Meed of Skeed on Hold :).
</p>
<p>
  The above objective is complete as well, now lets move on to make a reviews application.

<span>Will deploy on vercel or AWS EC2 on an Apache server</span>
