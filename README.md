<h1>A Test Car Game for me</h1>
<p>
  I am making this game for learning purpose, will be trying to implement a simple car game with basic features turning, moving forward and reverse. A brief list of objectives is written below.
  <ol>
    <li>Go forward</li>
    <li>Make a left turn</li>
    <li>Make a right turn</li>
    <li>Go backwards (reverse)</li>
  </ol>
  Upon completion of the above will see make the game more intense.
